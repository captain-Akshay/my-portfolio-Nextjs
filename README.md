## getting started

## Deploy on Vercel
### prerequisites

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
- have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine
- have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine
- basic familiarity with your machine's command line
- basic understanding of JSON data outline (arrays of objects basically)
- basic understanding of [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) framework

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
## how to use

- fork the repository and clone locally
- cd into the project and run `npm install` to install dependencies
- once installation is complete, run `npm run dev` to get your local copy running in the browser(localhost:3000).
- Added the `how-tosteup.next.config.js` to check how to configure the `next.config.js` for environment variables.

### edit `Info.js`

Next, open the project in your code editor. Navigate to `src/info/Info.js`. There are some instructions written in the
comments there, but I will go over it all here as well:

### How to create project mock-ups in Canva

You must have a Canva account for this to work! If you don't want to create one, feel free to send me laptop and mobile sized screenshots of your projects and I will make some mocks for you! It just might take a couple days to get to them. My contact info can be found on my Github profile or in this readme. Feel free to contact via Twitter or email, or to open an issue on this project.

Now, then!

The easiest way is to click on [this link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFnNEeMRg4/YiYjSvsMGn2tqjw9ubsiqw/edit?utm_content=DAFnNEeMRg4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) and edit with the desktop and mobile views of your project. 

1. Double-click the "computer" screen in the mockup linked above, and click "delete" on your keyboard to remove it. Do the same with the screenshot that is in mobile. Once completed, it should look like this: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/213895660-11caf808-e929-4569-b404-92ff742bb3ff.png)

2. On the left sidebar, click "uploads" and then "upload files" to upload your screenshots of your own project (get one for desktop view and one for mobile view)

3. Drag those screenshots into the appropriate frames, replacing the cloud-and-sky background. It should snap right in.

4. Finally, at the top right corner, click on the "Share" button and then "Download" -- set the file type to PNG, and then download. If you have Canva Premium, you can do this with a transparent background. If not, remove the background yourself using either a photo editor like Photopea, or an AI background remover (just google it, you can usually use them for free a few times). 

5. These are the images you will want to put in the img/ folder of the project and name "mock1" "mock2" etc. etc. Hope this helps!

## Test (Cypress)
